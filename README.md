## Tech Stack

We use Clojure and PostgreSQL on server-side, ClojureScript and Om on the client-side.
Dreiser is web based application with traditional architecture.


## Instructions

To run Dreiser locally you need to have Clojure, Node.js and PostgreSQL installed.
Clojure uses [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) as package manager. Please install it.


### Database setup

Than you need to create `dreiser` database in the PostgreSQL. This can be achived with

```
  CREATE DATABASE dreiser
```

Then open dreiser directory in terminal and run `lein ragtime up` - this will apply SQL migtrations.


### Frontend setup

You need to compile all frontend assets.

To compile ClojureScript into JavaScript in the new window run command

```
  lein cljsbuild auto
```

You can change your ClojureScript code and it will compiled to JavaScript automatically in the background.

To compile Stylus into CSS please navigate to the `frontend` directory. Install node.js dependencies and Gulp.js using `npm install` command.

Then run `gulp watch` in the separate window and your CSS will be compiled automatically.
